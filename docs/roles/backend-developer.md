# Backend Developer Role Document for Habit Tracker 2.0

## Role Overview
The Backend Developer plays a critical role in the Habit Tracker 2.0 project by designing and implementing the server-side logic that supports the application's functionality. This role focuses on creating robust RESTful APIs, managing user authentication, and ensuring data integrity and security. The Backend Developer will work closely with the Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer to ensure seamless integration between the client and server, ultimately enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Design and Implement RESTful APIs for Data Management
- **Explanation**: The Backend Developer will create APIs that allow the frontend to interact with the database. This includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting habits.
- **Example**: Implementing an endpoint like `POST /api/habits` to allow users to create a new habit, which would involve validating input data and storing it in MongoDB.

### 2. Set Up User Authentication and Authorization
- **Explanation**: Implement secure user authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) to ensure that user data is protected.
- **Example**: Creating a `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint that validates user credentials and returns a token for authenticated sessions.

### 3. Develop the Database Schema and Manage Data Storage
- **Explanation**: The Backend Developer will design the MongoDB schema to efficiently store user habits and related data.
- **Example**: Defining a Mongoose model for habits that includes fields like `userId`, `habitName`, `frequency`, and `progress`.

### 4. Ensure Application Security and Data Integrity
- **Explanation**: Implement security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Example**: Using middleware to sanitize user inputs and validate data before processing.

### 5. Integrate Third-Party Services for Email Notifications
- **Explanation**: Set up integrations with services like SendGrid or Mailgun to send email reminders to users about their habits.
- **Example**: Implementing a function that triggers an email notification when a user creates a new habit.

## Technical Requirements
- **Node.js**: Proficiency in Node.js for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: Experience with Express.js for creating RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Knowledge of MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
- **RESTful APIs**: Understanding of REST principles to design scalable APIs.
- **Authentication**: Familiarity with authentication methods (JWT, OAuth) for securing user data.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional RESTful APIs for habit management.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Database schema and models for MongoDB.
- Documentation for API endpoints and usage.
- Integration of email notification services.

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Developer**: Collaborate to define API contracts and ensure the frontend correctly consumes the backend services.
- **UI/UX Designer**: Work together to understand user requirements and ensure that backend functionality supports the desired user experience.

## Development Workflow
- **Branching Strategy**: Use Git branching strategy (e.g., feature branches) to manage code changes.
- **Code Review Process**: Participate in peer code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
- **Testing Approach**: Implement unit tests for API endpoints using tools like Mocha or Jest, and conduct integration testing to ensure all components work together.

## Technical Decisions
- Choose the appropriate authentication method (e.g., JWT vs. session-based) based on project requirements.
- Decide on the structure of the MongoDB schema to optimize for performance and scalability.
- Determine the best approach for handling errors and logging within the application.
